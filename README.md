Das Orakel von Mägdesprung
A contemporary oracle rooted in ancient wisdom, myth, and industrial heritage.

🌿 What is it?
Das Orakel von Mägdesprung is a large-scale, interactive landscape art installation located on the grounds of a former ironworks in Mägdesprung, in the Harz Mountains (Germany). Inspired by ancient local cult places and international places of wisdom, like Oracle of Delphi. Das Orakel von Mägdesprung invites visitors to ask meaningful personal questions and reflect deeply.

This modern oracle is neither esoteric nor religious—it’s a philosophical, participatory experience blending art, nature, history and mythology.

🌀 Structure
The Oracle consists of two main areas:

Outer District: Marked forest paths for contemplative walks that help refine the question you're bringing to the oracle.

64 birch trees

24 seven-meter-high "symbol towers"

The Eiserne Krone ("Iron Crown")—a 4-meter-high circular structure at the center

A color wheel of 64 flags, each linked to I Ching texts

Visitors journey through these zones to reach the Orakelhof (Oracle Court), the core of the experience.

🛠 This project: AI Oracle?
The AI Oracle is a chatbot and reflection partner that brings the spirit of the oracle into the digital realm. It invites users to ask deep, open-ended questions and responds with a mix of:

🔍 Philosophical inquiry

🧠 Psychological reflection

✨ Symbolic interpretation

⚖️ Ethical and spiritual prompts

📜 Wisdom from myth, religion, and cultural traditions

Like the physical oracle, it does not predict the future — it helps you to explore the present more consciously. Like this it leads closer to the answers. 

🎯 Purpose of the AI Oracle
Offer an introspective companion for those unable to visit Mägdesprung

Preparation of the actual physical visit of DAS ORAKEL VON MÄGDESPRUNG 

Expand the reach of the oracle’s cultural and symbolic dialogue

Translate ancient methods of reflection into contemporary AI dialogue

Continue the project’s mission of interdisciplinary, non-dogmatic exploration
